# Doom Configuration

This is my personal config for [DOOM
Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs). This is provided as is, and I
make no guarantees about the correctness or stability of my config.

## Installation

Reliant on doom and `git`, there should be nothing to do for installing the
general case. Some language specific binaries need to be installed. These include:
  * `rust-analyzer`: This can be easily installed with `brew`. Alternatively, we
    can build from source, following the instructions
    [here](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#installation).
